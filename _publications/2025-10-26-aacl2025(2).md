excerpt: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used for modeling sentiment trends on social media text. We examine whether LLMs have a polarity association bias---positive or negative---when encountering specific types of lexical word mentions. Such polarity association bias could lead to the wrong classification of neutral statements and thus a distorted estimation of sentiment trends. We estimate the severity of the polarity association bias across five widely used LLMs, identifying lexical word mentions spanning a diverse range of linguistic and psychological categories that correlate with this bias. Our results show a moderate to strong degree of polarity association bias in these LLMs.

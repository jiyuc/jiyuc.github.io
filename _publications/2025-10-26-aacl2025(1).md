excerpt: Hassles and uplifts are psychological constructs of individuals' positive or negative responses to daily minor incidents, with cumulative impacts on mental health. These concepts are largely overlooked in NLP, where existing tasks and models focus on identifying general sentiment expressed in text. These, however, cannot satisfy targeted information needs in psychological inquiry. To address this, we introduce Hassles and Uplifts Detection (HUD), a novel application to identify these constructs in social media language. We evaluate various language models and task adaptation approaches on a probing dataset collected from a private, real-time emotional venting platform. Some of our models achieve F scores close to 80%. We also identify open opportunities to improve affective language understanding in support of studies in psychology.
